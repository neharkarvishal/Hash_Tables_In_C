# Writing a hash table in C.

[Hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) are one of the most useful data structures. Their quick and scalable
insert, search and delete make them relevant to a large number of computer
science problems.

By working through this, we will gain:

- Understanding of how a fundamental data structure works under the hood
- Deeper knowledge of when to use hash tables, when not to use them, and how
  they can fail
- Exposure to new C code

C is a great language to write a hash table in because:

- The language doesn't come with one included
- It is a low-level language, so you get deeper exposure to how things work at a
  machine level
